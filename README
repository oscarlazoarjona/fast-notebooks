This is a database of notebooks featuring the use of FAST to generate optical Bloch equations 
both symbolically and numericall, as well as a few exercises in atomic physics. The notebooks
can be viewed online, but in order to execute them interactively you'll need to install FAST
in your coumputer. It can be downloaded from

Enjoy!
